            <p class="text-light " style="font-size:large">
                uMalusi, surprisingly, was originally founded with the intent to address environmental sustainability in South Africa. 
                We have recognized that small-scale farmers do not  have access to commercial tools and devices and rural economic development is not exclusive of one another and that is why we came up with a tracking device to help small-scale farmers keep track and to trace their livestock remotely. 
                We are a unique team made up of mixed gender individuals of color with different cultural and educational backgrounds but very similar socio-economic backgrounds and this makes us a very diverse but closely knitted team that can empathize with the needs of our users
